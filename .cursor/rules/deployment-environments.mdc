# Deployment and Environments

This project is configured for deployment with multiple environments and Docker containerization.

## Environment Variables

- [Dockerfile](mdc:Dockerfile) - Main container configuration
- [docker-compose.yml](mdc:docker-compose.yml) - Development environment setup

## Deployment Workflows

The deployment process follows these principles:

1. Development in local environment
2. Testing in preview environment
3. Production deployment to main domain

## Build and Runtime Configuration

Build configuration is managed through:

1. [next.config.mjs](mdc:next.config.mjs) - Next.js configuration
2. [postcss.config.mjs](mdc:postcss.config.mjs) - PostCSS and Tailwind configuration

## Performance Optimization
