# Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using Next.js 15 with React 19 and uses a combination of Tailwind CSS v4 and CSS modules for styling.

## Key Frontend Files

- [src/app/(frontend)/layout.tsx](mdc:src/app/(frontend)/layout.tsx) - Main layout component
- [src/app/(frontend)/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/(frontend)/page.tsx) - Home page component
- [src/app/(frontend)/globals.css](mdc:src/app/(frontend)/globals.css) - Global CSS styles with Tailwind imports
- [src/app/(frontend)/landing.module.css](mdc:src/app/(frontend)/landing.module.css) - CSS modules for the landing page

## Page Structure

Pages are organized in the `src/app/(frontend)/pages` directory with each page having its own directory:

- `/pages/welcome` - Welcome page
- `/pages/about` - About page
- `/pages/projects` - Projects page
- `/pages/services` - Services page

## Component Organization

Components are organized in `src/app/(frontend)/components` by feature or function:

- `/components/common` - Reusable components
- `/components/animation` - Animation-related components
- `/components/main` - Main content components

## Styling Approach

The project uses:
1. Tailwind CSS v4 for utility classes
2. CSS modules for component-specific styles
3. Custom utility classes defined in globals.css
4. Theme variables for light/dark mode in globals.css
